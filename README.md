### Technologies
+ Vue.js (Vue2) 

### Task description
Create a game based on Simon's game.
Rules:
+ The playing field consists of 4 squares / buttons, each of which produces a certain tone and "lights up" when pressed.
+ A round in the game consists of a device illuminating one or more buttons in random order. After that, the player must reproduce this order by pressing the buttons.
+ If the player successfully replays the sequence, then they move on to the next round.
+ If the player doesn't play the sequence, then the game is over (a notification should
be displayed to the user).
+ The number of buttons (sequence) increases with each round.

### Employer's requirements  
+ When playing the sequence, the buttons/square should "light up".
+ Each button/square should make a unique sound during the game.
+ There should be 3 levels of difficulty - easy, normal and difficult.
  + Easy: the time between each button in the sequence should be 1.5 sec.
  + Average: The time between each button in the sequence should be 1.0 sec.
  + Complex: The time between each button in the sequence should be 0.4 sec.
+ Time should be spent on functionality, not design, and the basic design of the game should be respected.
